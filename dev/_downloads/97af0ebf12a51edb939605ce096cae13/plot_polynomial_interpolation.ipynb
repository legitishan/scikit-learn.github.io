        "\n# Polynomial and Spline interpolation\n\nThis example demonstrates how to approximate a function with polynomials up to\ndegree ``degree`` by using ridge regression. We show two different ways given\n``n_samples`` of 1d points ``x_i``:\n\n- :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures` generates all monomials\n  up to ``degree``. This gives us the so called Vandermonde matrix with\n  ``n_samples`` rows and ``degree + 1`` columns::\n\n    [[1, x_0, x_0 ** 2, x_0 ** 3, ..., x_0 ** degree],\n     [1, x_1, x_1 ** 2, x_1 ** 3, ..., x_1 ** degree],\n     ...]\n\n  Intuitively, this matrix can be interpreted as a matrix of pseudo features\n  (the points raised to some power). The matrix is akin to (but different from)\n  the matrix induced by a polynomial kernel.\n\n- :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.SplineTransformer` generates B-spline basis\n  functions. A basis function of a B-spline is a piece-wise polynomial function\n  of degree ``degree`` that is non-zero only between ``degree+1`` consecutive\n  knots. Given ``n_knots`` number of knots, this results in matrix of\n  ``n_samples`` rows and ``n_knots + degree - 1`` columns::\n\n    [[basis_1(x_0), basis_2(x_0), ...],\n     [basis_1(x_1), basis_2(x_1), ...],\n     ...]\n\nThis example shows that these two transformers are well suited to model\nnon-linear effects with a linear model, using a pipeline to add non-linear\nfeatures. Kernel methods extend this idea and can induce very high (even\ninfinite) dimensional feature spaces.\n"

        "This shows nicely that higher degree polynomials can fit the data better. But\nat the same time, too high powers can show unwanted oscillatory behaviour\nand are particularly dangerous for extrapolation beyond the range of fitted\ndata. This is an advantage of B-splines. They usually fit the data as well as\npolynomials and show very nice and smooth behaviour. They have also good\noptions to control the extrapolation, which defaults to continue with a\nconstant. Note that most often, you would rather increase the number of knots\nbut keep ``degree=3``.\n\nIn order to give more insights into the generated feature bases, we plot all\ncolumns of both transformers separately.\n\n"
